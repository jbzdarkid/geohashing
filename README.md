This bot is an alternate version of [relet's geohashing bot](https://github.com/relet/pygeohashing), which is more specifically focused on notifications.
Uses Github actions to run the bot every day, and posts 'notifications' via wiki page edit. Not a perfect system but very easily autonomous.

For stability, I have also hosted a copy of the [centicle calcualator](https://jbzdarkid.github.io/geohashing/equvix.html), since the old one went offline.

PRs welcome, although I sincerely doubt anyone is going to be interested in this repo.
